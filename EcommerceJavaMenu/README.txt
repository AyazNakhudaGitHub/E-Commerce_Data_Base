DeleteTables:
This image highlights the execution of the Delete Tables option - Drops all tables and views related to the e-commerce database system from the db cascading constraints in order to not violate any foreign key constraints.
Displays either a successful deletion print out or the error code and message generated by the db upon attempting statement execution - i.e., Table or View does not exist

CreateTables:
This image highlights the execution of the Create Tables option - Creates all tables and views related to the e-commerce database system from the db.
Displays either a successful creation print out or the error code and message generated by the db upon attempting statement execution - i.e., Object already exists

PopulateTables:
This image highlights the execution of the Populate Tables option - Inserts a collection of predefined dummy data into the tables of the e-commerce db in order to facilitate report generation
and querying.
Displays either a successful Row Inserted print out or the error code and message generated by the db upon attempting statement execution.

QueryTables:
This image highlights the execution of the Query Tables option - Performs a collection of predefined queries in order to generate a report style output of return values with associated headers to describe the meaning of the results.

Displays either a successful result report with a corresponding header for each query along with the structure of the returned values in terms of the column names
or the error code and message generated by the db upon attempting statement execution - i.e., Object already exists

CustomQuery:
This image highlights the execution of the Custom Query option - Allows the user to perform any SQL statement they need on the e-commerce db including queries and 
update/delete/insert statements. This facilitates the ability for users to select specific records from the db and manage the db as needed.
The custom query option brings the user to a sub-menu of sorts allowing them to either enter a SQL statement or press X to return to the main menu.
Upon entering a statement the user will also be returned to the main menu upon completion.

Displays either the results of a query or executes a CRUD command within the db or the error code and message if an improper statement is passed.
